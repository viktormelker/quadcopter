Files first tested 20140129.

There are two projects here, one uses std library function "pulseIn()" to read RC inputs, which returns
 high time of a signal. This routine locks when called. The other project uses interrupts and manually
calculating high time of input signals.

During testing no output was sent to the motors, but the code for this is present.
Instead the high-time of input from RC was printed to terminal.

When using pulseIn() no input was printed to the terminal, only 0's. When using interrupts the Arduino
 behaved strangely, sometimes printing as it should and on other occasions only printing what was printed
 in Setup() as if hanged in the interupts.
